fix this later
The actual data columns are:
Geneid (gene IDs like ENSG00000223972.5)
Chr (chromosome locations, sometimes multiple locations per gene)
Start (start positions, sometimes multiple per gene)
End (end positions, sometimes multiple per gene)
Strand (+ or - strand info)
Length (numeric value representing gene length)
The last column contains the actual counts from the BAM file (named "tests/data/results/aligned/pranay.bam")
The issue is that our code is looking for a column named 'raw_counts', but this file doesn't have that exact column name. Instead, the counts are in the last column named "tests/data/results/aligned/pranay.bam".
